# Personal Portfolio Website

Hello and welcome to the repo for my personal website.

I built this site using React (v18) and Vite to showcase my skills, projects, and professional resume. The website features a clean, responsive design, with a focus on user experience and modern web development practices.

## Features:
- **Resume Section**: Easy access to my professional resume and experience.
- **Custom Components**: Built with reusable React components for maintainability and efficiency.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive across different screen sizes and devices.

Check out the live site to learn more about my work!
